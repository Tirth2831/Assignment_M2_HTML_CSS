             the Internet. Web servers receive requests from web browsers, process them, and send back the requested webpages

HTML : HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language".
       HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It consists of a set of 
       tags and attributes that define the structure and semantics of a webpage. HTML tags are used to format text, insert images, 
       create hyperlinks, and define other elements of a webpage.

CSS : CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".
      CSS is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows web developers
      to define the appearance of elements on a webpage, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning. CSS can be applied 
      internally within an HTML document, externally through separate CSS files, or inline within HTML tags.



8. In how many ways can a CSS be integrated as a web page?
ans.

There are several ways to integrate CSS into a web page:

1.Inline CSS
2.Internal CSS
3.External CSS

Inline CSS : CSS can be applied directly to HTML elements using the 'style' attribute. This method is useful for 
             applying unique styles to individual elements.

Internal CSS: You can also include CSS directly within the HTML document using the <style> tag in the <head> section.
              This is useful for small-scale styling.

External CSS: This is the most common method. You create a separate CSS file with the styling rules and link it to
              your HTML document using the <link> tag in the <head> section.
